Rust port of Wincent's [InfectedRose.Interface](https://github.com/Wincent01/InfectedRose).

It is not finished, and can currently only be used for **adding** objects and components to the FDB. Locale additions are not yet supported, and SQLite export isn't in yet either.
Apart from these restrictions, it can be used in the same way as InfectedRose.Interface, and it is intended to be fully compatible with the mod format.

_Some parts could use a rewrite, as I am still learning rust and have made some questionable design choices._
