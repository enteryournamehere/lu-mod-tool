Rust port of Wincent's [InfectedRose.Interface](https://github.com/Wincent01/InfectedRose/tree/modding/InfectedRose.Interface#readme).

It is not finished, and can currently only be used for **adding** objects and components to the FDB, not editing or removing them.
Apart from this restriction, it can be used in the same way as InfectedRose.Interface, and it is intended to be fully compatible with the mod format and command line interface.

_Some parts could use a rewrite, as I am still learning rust and have made some questionable design choices._
